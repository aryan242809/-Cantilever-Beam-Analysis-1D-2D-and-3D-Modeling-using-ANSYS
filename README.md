# Cantilever-Beam-Analysis-1D-2D-and-3D-Modeling-using-ANSYS
This repository presents the simulation of cantilever beams using 1D, 2D, and 3D finite element models in ANSYS Workbench. All models are developed in a single ANSYS project file, maintaining consistent geometry properties, boundary conditions, and loading parameters across all simulations for comparative analysis.

📄 Assignment Overview
The study involves the step-by-step development and analysis of a cantilever beam, focusing on:
Creating 1D, 2D, and 3D models under a unified 3D geometry setting.

Assigning:
A cross-section for the 1D model. |
A thickness of 0.05m for the 2D model.

Applying boundary conditions: 
One end of the beam is fixed. |
A 1 kN force is applied on the free end.

Solving the models to evaluate:
Total displacement |
Maximum and equivalent stress |
Performing modal analysis to extract the first 10 natural frequencies for each model.
