# -Cantilever-Beam-Analysis-1D-2D-and-3D-Modeling-using-ANSYS
This repository presents the simulation of cantilever beams using 1D, 2D, and 3D finite element models in ANSYS Workbench. All models are developed in a single ANSYS project file, maintaining consistent geometry properties, boundary conditions, and loading parameters across all simulations for comparative analysis.
